First of all, welcome! If you are reading this, I'd love to hear about how you've landed on my brand new website.
Earlier in June, I decided to take down the personal website which was built with VueJs and Bootstrap, with the plan, at that point in time, to re-design it in Figma and re-write it using TailwindCSS.
