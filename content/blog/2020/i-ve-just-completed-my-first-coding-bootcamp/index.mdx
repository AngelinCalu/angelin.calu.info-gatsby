As the title says, I've just completed my first coding bootcamp. It lasted for four months between August and December 2020 and this had quite an impact on the choice of tools used to re-build this website.

It all started on July 29th 2020, one day after my birthday, when I noticed a Facebook Ad saying something like _"It's time to get the missing certification for your coding skills, and learn more about TypeScript"_. Not sure what filters they used to target their ads on Facebook (or what information Facebook might have about my coding skills) but I really felt like the text was kind of written for me. I applied, and some days later I've been called by someone from the company helding the bootcamp and held some sort of phone interview about my skills.

Later, in August, I was very happy to receive the answer that I've been accepted into the bootcamp (there were around 50 applicants, and 15 places in the bootcamp).
