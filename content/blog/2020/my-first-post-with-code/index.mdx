# Here is the H1

## Here's a H2 title

### H3 looks like this

#### H4 comes next

##### H5 should also be formatted

###### H6 is the last heading

And then, take a look at this `inline code`.

This is an unordered list:

-   Item 1
-   Item 2
-   Item 3

This is an **ordered** list

1. First Item
2. Second _item_
    - nested item
    - second nested item
3. Third item

~~strikethrough~~

Later this should also render nicely:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
```
