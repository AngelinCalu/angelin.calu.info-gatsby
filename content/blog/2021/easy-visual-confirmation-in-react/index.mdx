## Intro

During the past weekend I've been spending some time on setting up the code blocks visuals on this blog. After styling things a bit, I wanted to offer my readers a chance to grab the code with a _"Copy to Clipboard"_ button.

<Callout>

**Note!** This article describes how I implemented this functionality in my personal blog, which is made with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) but same principles would apply with any [React](https://reactjs.org/) project with or without a CSS framework.

So, I've added the functionality in a `copyToClipboard()` function placed inside a new utils folder: `src/utils/copy-to-clipboard.js`, and made sure that the function would return `true` when the copy operation completes successfully and `false` otherwise.
